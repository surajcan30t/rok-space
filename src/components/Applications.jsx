    bigDesc: `As a fiber operator, you face significant costs and challenges in developing and maintaining content for all customer support channels. Your customers expect intuitive, effortless service experiences, like those offered by ChatGPT. However, the complexity of backend systems, a wide range of devices, and limited automation make it difficult to meet these expectations.

-High costs & effort for support content
-High customer expectations for intuitive service
-Complex technology with backend & many devices

As a result, many customers avoid self-service channels and turn to customer support representatives instead. They themselves struggle with high call volumes, limited training and complexity of customer issues. This leads to long wait times, higher interaction costs, and dissatisfied customers, while the potential of self-care remains untapped. Changing the status quo typically requires significant investments, and building customer support from scratch isn’t a viable option. This leaves customer support executives in a dilemma of how to initiate truly significant improvements. 

-Customers bypass self-service, overwhelming support teams.
-This leads to long waits, high costs, and unmet self-service potential.
-Significant improvements demand high investment, creating executive uncertainty.

    bigDescHead: `Proactively resolve customer issues and ensure growing revenue from 3rd and 1st party services`,
    bigDesc: `Driven by an increasing number of connected devices, Smart Home systems, OTT services, and 3rd party offerings, the growing scope and complexity of telecom infrastructure puts significant pressure on providers. Effective monitoring and proactively resolving problems is becoming more difficult, while telecom companies remain responsible for ensuring seamless functionality across all services. Managing these challenges without effective tools makes it increasingly difficult to prevent and resolve issues proactively. Where systems already provide proactive functionality like alarming, the information is not fully leveraged for proactive resolutions or tied back to customer impact.

-Growing device numbers and service complexity strain telecom providers.
-Monitoring and proactive issue resolution are becoming more challenging.
-Existing systems generate alerts but fail to drive proactive solutions.

Frequent outages and service failures, regardless of their origin, severely damage customer satisfaction and lead to churn. For telecom companies, this immensely threatens the viability of OTT or bundled services, which are critical for revenue. Without proactive solutions, reactive issue resolution becomes costly, labor-intensive, and inefficient, delaying root cause identification and preventing continuous improvement.

-Frequent outages hurt customer satisfaction and increase churn.
-Service failures threaten the viability of OTT and bundled offerings.
-Reactive troubleshooting is costly, slow, and hinders continuous improvement.

    bigDescHead: `Resell customer support solutions to ISPs to save effort, reduce costs and unlock new revenue streams `,
    bigDesc: `The shared use of physical network infrastructure by multiple providers makes managing, monitoring, and maintaining the network highly complex. When faults or outages occur, identifying the cause becomes challenging because issues can originate at different levels—end customer, ISP, or network owner. ISPs often lack expertise in direct customer support, creating additional work for network owners. Manual error identification and resolution leads to delays, increased workload, and growing customer dissatisfaction.

-Shared network infrastructure complicates management, monitoring, and maintenance.
-Fault identification is challenging, as issues can stem from customers, ISPs, or network owners.
-Manual troubleshooting causes delays, higher workloads, and customer dissatisfaction.

This situation results in significant challenges for all parties. Network owners face higher costs and increased workloads, even when they are not responsible for the problem. ISPs suffer financial losses due to unresolved customer issues caused by a lack of problem-solving capabilities. End customers experience dissatisfaction because they lack self-service solutions to resolve issues quickly. The absence of automation further compounds the problem, as identifying root causes and responsibilities takes significant time, delaying resolutions and straining resources. 

-Network owners bear high costs and workloads.
-ISPs lose revenue from unresolved issues.
-Customers lack self-service, and delays worsen without automation.

HRAIZN OAN localizes root causes and automates troubleshooting wherever possible. This reduces workload, shortens resolution times, and improves overall efficiency. HRAIZN OAN enables network owners to resell intelligent customer support solutions to ISPs. Therefore, it reduces costs and effort while opening new revenue streams. Utilizing HRAIZN OAN, ISPs can offer advanced self-care applications that help end customers resolve issues more efficiently, leading to enhanced satisfaction and fewer escalated problems for network owners. Network owners benefit from additional revenue, meeting SLAs more effectively and differentiating their offerings.

-HRAIZN OAN automates troubleshooting, reducing workload and resolution times.
-Network owners can resell support solutions to ISPs, cutting costs and creating new revenue streams.
-ISPs offer self-care tools, improving customer satisfaction and minimizing escalations.
